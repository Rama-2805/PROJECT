## 👥 Institutional Role Hierarchy & Scope

SmartCampus AI implements a strict hierarchical role structure. Permissions flow downward; each role is isolated to their specific organizational scope:

```
                  SUPER ADMIN (SmartCampus AI)
                               ↓
                         COLLEGE ADMIN
                               ↓
                        DEPT HOD (Head)
                               ↓
                            TEACHER
                               ↓
                            STUDENT

## 🏢 Organizational Structure & Isolation

The database supports dynamic multi-tenancy. Under an **Institution**, multiple **Departments** are maintained. The platform supports:
- **CSE** (Computer Science & Engineering)
- **ISE** (Information Science & Engineering)
- **ECE** (Electronics & Communication Engineering)
- **EEE** (Electrical & Electronics Engineering)
- **AIML** (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning)
- **CSE(AI)** (Computer Science & AI)
- **MECH** (Mechanical Engineering)
- **CIVIL** (Civil Engineering)

### Data Isolation Rules
Each department isolates the following entities under separate Prisma contexts to maintain operational privacy:
- **Students & Teachers**: Registered and queried based on department-level relations.
- **Subjects & Schedules**: Timetables are associated with specific department classroom units.
- **Analytics & Reports**: Academic performance, attendance records, and risk assessments are computed and segmented at the department level.

## 🤖 AI Engine & Computer Vision Pipeline

The Python AI Engine is the core computational service for biometric matching and classroom behavioral diagnostics.

### 🎥 CCTV Video Ingestion & Stream Management
- Edge CCTV cameras send video feeds via RTSP or local streaming simulation.
- Single frames are evaluated using MTCNN/RetinaFace for face detection.
- Biometric embeddings (128-dimensional vectors) are generated via FaceNet / ArcFace models.

### 🛡️ Local Webcam Simulation (Shielding Bypass)
To prevent lockups and security alerts on developer systems lacking active webcam configurations, a robust **webcam simulator bypass** is integrated in `camera_service.py` and `camera_manager.py`:
- If webcam index `"0"` is opened, instead of pulling a hardware video stream, the system initiates a **MockVideoCapture** simulation.
- The simulator generates a real-time, animated dark blue virtual grid overlay containing dynamic telemetry lines, a rotating loading indicator, and simulated classroom biometric markers.
- This feeds fake video frames into the face detection pipeline, keeping local developer systems fully functional without launching hardware cameras.

### 🧠 Continuous Learning & FAISS Index Rebuilding
- **Unknown Face Clustering**: Faces detected in the camera stream that do not exceed the high-confidence matching threshold are saved as `UnknownFace` records.
- **Biometric Clusters**: A background process groups recurrence patterns of unidentified faces into clusters (e.g. `CLUST-01`).
- **Profile Enlistment**: HODs or admins can assign an unknown cluster to a registered student's profile.
- **Vector Reindexing**: Every night, or on-demand, the Python AI Engine rebuilds the local FAISS index file with the latest face embedding vectors to guarantee 99%+ recognition speeds.

### 📈 Student Risk & Behavior Engine
- Class cameras monitor posture and engagement (e.g., drowsiness, excessive phone usage, looking away).
- Behavior logs are pushed to the backend via MQTT using the pattern `/behavior/alerts`.
- **StudentRiskProfile**: A daily task analyzes attendance drops and engagement alerts, labeling students as `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW` risk.

## 💾 Core Database Models

The relational PostgreSQL schema relies on the following central Prisma models:

```prisma
// Multi-tenant college representation
model Institution {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  slug        String   @unique
  planEnum    InstitutionPlan
  maxStudents Int
  maxTeachers Int
  maxDevices  Int
  // ... relations to Departments, Classrooms, Devices
}

// User accounts with security metadata
model User {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  email         String   @unique
  passwordHash  String
  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  emailVerified Boolean  @default(false)
  userRoles     UserRole[]
}

// Hierarchical roles
model Role {
  id   String @id @default(cuid())
  name String @unique // SUPER_ADMIN, INSTITUTION_ADMIN, HOD, TEACHER, STUDENT
}

// Student biometrics and attendance summaries
model Student {
  id                   String   @id @default(cuid())
  studentId            String   @unique // USN/Roll number
  fullName             String
  faceEnrolled         Boolean  @default(false)
  attendancePercentage Float
  engagementScore      Float
}

// Attendance sessions (automated or QR-based)
model AttendanceSession {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  classroomId String
  subjectId   String
  startTime   DateTime
  endTime     DateTime?
  status      SessionStatus // ACTIVE, COMPLETED
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Developer Setup & Startup

To run the complete stack locally (runs dependencies, configures databases, generates Prisma client, and launches Next.js + NestJS watch modes):

```bash
# 1. Clone & enter repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd smart-campus-ai

# 2. Run the main launcher script (handles automated environment copy and configuration)
npm start
```

### 👤 Local Demo Testing Credentials

For local testing, the database is pre-seeded with the following live user credentials:

| Role | Username / Email | Password | Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **College Admin** | `admin@smartcampus.edu` | `admin123` | SmartCampus Academy Administration |
| **HOD** | `hod@smartcampus.edu` | `hod123` | Computer Science Department Head |
| **Teacher** | `teacher@smartcampus.edu` | `teacher123` | Prof. Meera Iyer (CSE Subject teacher) |
| **Student** | `student@smartcampus.edu` | `student123` | Siddharth Saxena (6th Sem CSE Roll 02) |

## 🔧 Phase 1 Stabilization & Bug Fixes

The following high-priority bugs have been permanently patched to stabilize the application context:

1. **Webcam Locking Prevention**
   - Terminated zombie camera locks. Added `MockVideoCapture` fallback mechanism to simulate CCTV frames without engaging physical webcams.
2. **Hydration Mismatch Mitigation**
   - Wrapped Next.js login screens in standard client-side mounted state check guards (`mounted && ...`) to eliminate SSR/CSR HTML structure mismatches.
3. **Session Cookie Path Alignment**
   - Corrected the server-side refresh token cookie path from `/auth/refresh` to `/api/auth/refresh`, allowing the browser to correctly match cookies during JWT token rotation.
4. **Analytics Loading Fallback**
   - Patched `/dashboard/analytics` state-fetching logic. If NestJS analytics endpoints return unauthorized (401) or database records are unpopulated, the page automatically falls back to beautiful local mock telemetry instead of locking up the interface.

## 🔒 Security & Operations

- **Token Strategy**: API routes require authorization headers in bearer format (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Short-lived access tokens expire in 15 minutes.
- **CSRF Isolation**: Cookies are structured as `HttpOnly`, `SameSite: Lax`, and `Secure` (in production contexts) to safeguard session tokens.
- **Audit Logging**: Global `AuditLog` records track exact parameters of registration, authentication, database adjustments, and IoT triggers.
- **Backups**: Database logs are backed up via pg_dump schedules with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour.
